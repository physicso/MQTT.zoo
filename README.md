# MQTT.zoo
Realization of simple MQTT clients for a variety of languages.

Although simple enough (I am continuously revising them), MQTT.zoo enables people with few programming skills of a particular language struggling to connect their geek stuff to the Internet through [MQTT protocol], an excellent transmitting protocol designed for IoT (Internet of Things).
