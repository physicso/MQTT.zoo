MQTT.zoo
=========


Realization of simple MQTT clients for a variety of languages.

Overview
------------

Although simple enough (I am continuously revising them), MQTT.zoo enables people with few programming skills of a particular language struggling to connect their geek stuff to the Internet through [MQTT protocol], an excellent transmitting protocol designed for IoT (Internet of Things).


A Note on RabbitMQ
------------

For users who are using [RabbitMQ] as the MQTT broker, please remind that the username for authentication should be:

    vitual-host-name:username

For more information, please visit [RabbitMQ MQTT Adapter] page.
